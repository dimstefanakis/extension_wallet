# Before nextjs stuff
## Libraries used
- React query
- Redux toolkit
- Chakra UI
- React input mask
- React testing library
## Folder structure
The folder structure is the *features / flat (or components)* design. Basically anything that classifies as a *feature* will go under the *feature* folder, this is mostly business logic and similar stuff. Anything else purely for design / layout / containers etc will go under the *flat* folder.
## Mock data
Mock data are available in the `/mockdata` folder

## Mock api requests
Mock api requests are under `/src/features/Authentication/Register/hooks` and are mocked used *react-query mutations and queries*

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

## Build
```bash
npm run build
```
## Run Tests
```bash
npm run test
```
